# Intro Scripts

This is a folder with a couple of scripts for you to play with. We encourage you to run them, change something around, and then run them again! 

## Script Details

1. `hello.py` - This is your standard "Hello world" program. 
2. `sum.py` - This prompts the user for two numbers, and prints out their sum.
3. `calc_degrees.py` - This takes in a temperature, and returns the degrees as if translating that temperature both *from* Celsius to Fahrenheit and *from* Fahrenheit to Celsius. 
4. `user_v_machine.py` - Plays a game between the user and the computer. Do your best to win! 
5. `basic_turtle.py` - Draws a cool spiral on your screen, using `turtle`.
