# Installing Anaconda

Follow along with the instructions below for your particular operating
system. If you're working off a unix distribution that is not Mac OS X,
you should be able to just work off the Mac OS X instructions, but change
which installation of Anaconda you're downloading (i.e. the Ubuntu install
if you're running Ubuntu, or the Linux install if you're running a different
installation of Linux).

## Windows Users

Download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), making sure to select the Windows
version, and the version using **Python 2.7**. Make sure that you
have the **"Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable"** checked when going
through installation...

## Mac OS X Users

Download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), making sure to select the Mac OS X
version, and the version using **Python 2.7**. We also suggest you use the command line installer as it is more light-weight.

## How to launch Jupyter

There are two ways to do this:

 1. If you're comfortable in the terminal, run the command `jupyter notebook`
 2. Otherwise, use `Anaconda Navigator` to launch Jupyter.
