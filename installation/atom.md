# Installing Atom

This installation isn't as involved as Anaconda. You just need to navigate
to the [Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) site and download the version of Atom corresponding to your operating system (Windows or Mac OS X).

## Windows Users

Once you are done installing it, double check that it works by opening the
Atom editor. I suggest creating a desktop shortcut for Atom or pinning
it to you taskbar for easy access. We'll be using it a lot.

## Mac Users

Once you are done installing it, a window should pop up that allows you to
move it into your applications folder. I suggest doing that, and then
also putting it down in your dock for easy access.
