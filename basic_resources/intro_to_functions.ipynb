    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of the [Python Basic Resources](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/python-resources/tree/master/basic_resources) 4-part series produced by [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial moves very fast. If you would like a slower, more in-depth intro to Python, we suggest you take our [Intro to Python Evening Course](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/intro-to-python/). It's the perfect way to become familiar with Python + gain experience using Python to solve challenging problems.\n",

    "This document is a *Jupyter notebook*. If you are viewing it using GitHub, then you cannot execute the cells that contain Python code.

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are an essential part of coding and are a way of defining a procedure that you can reuse. They are incredibly helpful in writing clean, readable, and reusable code. I would encourage you to code using functions (or classes) whenever you can. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a very large number of built-in functions, as well as a vast repository of modules/libraries through which other functions (as well as classes) are available. Check out the [built-in function docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) to see all of the built-in functions that are available to use. One of the libraries whose functions I use regularly is the [itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) library. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a top-down level, functions name a piece of code that takes parameter(s) and allows you to write \"tiny commands\". The purpose/use of a functions should typically be able to be described in one sentence, and on average functions should probably be no longer than 10 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I create them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are defined using a `def` statement, followed by the name that you wish to give the function (this name should follow variable naming conventions - `camel_case` in Python), followed by a set of parentheses that contain any potential parameters that may be passed to the function. Next, we place a colon, and then finally we get to write code for the function body. This code must fall on one or more indented lines (note that the indentation is **crucial**). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def my_func(passed_arg1, passed_arg2, passed_arg3): \n",
    "    # code goes here \n",

    "### Variable Scope Part Two\n",
    "\n",
    "When **referencing** a variable in an expression, Python will search the following scopes to resolve the reference: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) The current function's scope.   \n",
    "2.) Any enclosing scopes (like other containing functions).   \n",
    "3.) The scope of the module that contains the code (also called *global scope*).   \n",
    "4.) The built-in scope (contains the built-in functions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "When **assigning** a value to a variable, things work a little bit differently. If the variable is **already defined** in the current scope, then it will just take on the new value that you assign it. However, if it is **not defined** in the **current** scope, then Python treats the assignment as a variable definition. Let's take a look at how this plays out..."
