    "### Quick Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of the [Python Basic Resources](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/python-resources/tree/master/basic_resources) 4-part series produced by [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial moves very fast. If you would like a slower, more in-depth intro to Python, we suggest you take our [Intro to Python Evening Course](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/intro-to-python/). It's the perfect way to become familiar with Python + gain experience using Python to solve challenging problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is a *Jupyter notebook*. If you are viewing it using GitHub, then you cannot execute the cells that contain Python code. To view **and run** this notebook you'll need to install Jupyter on your computer before you continue. See [these installation instructions](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/python-resources/tree/master/installation) for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming): \"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has many benefits (see *encapsulation*, *polymorphism*, and *inheritance* in the wiki), but it also kind of matches how we think about the world. The world is composed of *objects*, where objects can be people, houses, cars, buildings, etc. These *objects* have some properties about them (i.e. they contain data), and they can do things (i.e. they have methods that can be applied). Object oriented programming approaches a programming problem by using objects that interact with each other, much like they do in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) **Class** - used to refer to the abstract concept of an object.  \n",
    "2.) **Object** - An actual instance of a class.   \n",
    "3.) **Instance** - What Python returns when you tell it to create a class.   \n",
    "4.) **self** - Inside of a class, a variable for the instance/object being accessed (i.e. it holds a reference to the instance/object of that class).  \n",
    "5.) **attribute** / **field** / **property** - A property or piece of data that a class has, stored in a variable. All attributes/fields/properties within a class are assigned via self.  \n",
    "6.) **method** / **procedure** - A block of code that is accessible via the class, and typically acts on or with the classes attributes/fields/properties. All methods/procedures within a class are created via def. (they are really just functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out, I will treat attribute, field, and property as interchangeable, and I'll do the same with method and procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Class \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like defining a function, there is a common format to defining a class. It is almost exactly the same as defining a function, but we replace `def` with `class`. That is, we write `class`, then the name of the class that we are defining, followed by a set of parentheses, and finally a colon. After the colon is an indented block of code that we use to define the class attributes and methods. One subtle difference is that with functions, the standard is to name these beginning in lowercase and seperating words with underscores (*snake_case*), while with classes, the standard is to name these beginning in uppercase, and not separate words at all (*CamelCase*). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class MyClass(): \n",
    "    # Attributes and methods go in here. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation is just a fancy word for saying that we're going to create an instance of a particular class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "my_class = MyClass() # Now we have my_class as an instance of MyClass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Workings \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of a class, we can have both *attributes* and *methods*. We can then think of these *attributes* and *methods* as belonging to the class, and they become accessible via any instances of the class (through dot notation, which we'll get to in a second). Inside of the class, all of these *attributes* and *methods* are set and retrieved via *self*. Let's dive in...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The \\__init\\__() method \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every class you ever write will have an \\__init\\__() method. This method gets called every time that you create a new instance of a class, and handles any kind of setup that the class may require. Setup typically just involves assigning values to variables, which we can do with or without passing values in. "

    "The \\__init\\__()  method is a special type of [**magic method**](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html). Magic methods allow you to build a lot of functionality into your classes, most of which allow you to interact with your classes using a lot of the built-in functions. I don't use these often in my day to day, but the \\__len\\__(), \\__str\\__(), \\__repr__\\() ones are pretty common. The first lets you use the len() function on instances of your class, and the second to allow you to define a readable display of an instance of your class (used when printing or applying the str() function). \n",
